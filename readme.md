# AnimalShelter disclaimer:

## It would not be fair not to make reference in this project to several important topics outside the team, both training and Team 3, but which I believe are vitally important when it comes to understanding the result:

## * 1º The team was literally hit by illnesses of up to two of the team's relatives, denoting the team's resilience and how it grows in the face of adversity.
## * 2º The team was changed in up to three components, of the 4 that started, two left at two different times of the project, and only one came in that was admitted in a wonderful way, understanding the previous point, not letting the team get carried away by a possible mistake. atmosphere, on the contrary, laughter has abounded.
## * 3ºProblems in the Frontend that happened to the training team and that did not respond, so the team decided to create its own frontend to present a fully Viable MVP, leaving the work with docker and testing to later deliveries, even more so if we are now with continuous integration.

## In conclusion, it has been a pleasure to work with these people on this project.
